          <h4>Uplift Social and Economic Condition</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
        Poverty is undeniably the most critical social problem that affects most impoverished countries all over the world. It is usually caused by a variety of factors such as lack of quality education, lack of jobs, low economic growth, high inflation, natural disasters, over population, corruption and political instability. The Philippines is a country that exemplifies the correlation between these factors and poverty.  About 27% of Filipinos still live below the poverty line and while according to World Bank the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped in every other developing region in the world.Other surveys say that some Filipinos are still living on less than $1.25 per day and in order for a family to escape poverty they need to earn about P2,000.00 pesos or $48.00 a month! Bulig Foundation will encourage individuals and families to be self-sufficient by helping them find or create sustainable jobs. The foundation will explore programs that are proven to be helpful in uplifting the economic conditions in the poor communities. Bulig Foundation will make the programs available to poor individuals who show desire and willingness to work.The program will also be available to the impoverished and underserved families and communities both locally and globally

        </div>
        <p>
        It is a sad reality, but a large part of the population in some third world countries still live in poverty. There is still inequality when it comes to accessibility to good healthcare and dental care. Bulig Foundation hopes to help people who are living in these impoverished communities to have a chance to live a better and healthier lives through medical, surgical, dental and wellness missions. The services will be performed or delivered by volunteer healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, dentists, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, and other healthcare and non-healthcare volunteer professionals

          <h4>Financial assistance in education</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there are still a large portion of the population who are unable to afford to send children to school therefore perpetuating the cycle of poverty. In most third world countries insufficient funding is the biggest reason why children drop out of school. In some cases they are pulled out of school by their own parents so they can help the family earn extra money to buy food, clothing and other necessities. Bulig Foundation helps these individuals and families by offering them financial assistance in education so children can stay in school instead of in the fields.

              <h4>Help local communities obtain and maintain clean drinking water and clean, safe and sanitary living environment</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              There is still a significant portion in the worldâ€™s population that are without improved water or with no access to safe drinking water, and an even larger population without proper hygiene and sanitation. Unfortunately, most people may not even know the risks of having unsafe drinking water, poor hygiene and poor sanitation. As a result, people living in these areas are all at risk and predisposed to diseases and infections. Children are especially at greater risk for cognitive and developmental problems later in life.Bulig Foundation will collaborate with local health officials and help with providing individuals and families the education they need in terms of proper food preparation and preservation, teaching and giving them tools to maintain proper hygiene and a sanitary environment.
