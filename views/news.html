                <h4>Uplift Social and Economic Condition</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
              Poverty is undeniably the most critical social problem that affects most impoverished countries all over the world. It is usually caused by a variety of factors such as lack of quality education, lack of jobs, low economic growth, high inflation, natural disasters, over population, corruption and political instability. The Philippines is a country that exemplifies the correlation between these factors and poverty.  About 27% of Filipinos still live below the poverty line and while according to World Bank the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped in every other developing region in the world.Other surveys say that some Filipinos are still living on less than $1.25 per day and in order for a family to escape poverty they need to earn about P2,000.00 pesos or $48.00 a month! Bulig Foundation will encourage individuals and families to be self-sufficient by helping them find or create sustainable jobs. The foundation will explore programs that are proven to be helpful in uplifting the economic conditions in the poor communities. Bulig Foundation will make the programs available to poor individuals who show desire and willingness to work.The program will also be available to the impoverished and underserved families and communities both locally and globally
